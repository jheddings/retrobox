# retrobox

Running RetroPie in a Docker container, especially on macOS.

## Dependencies

You'll need XQuartz to run this on macOS.  Specifically, version 2.7.8 has been tested.
Other versions of XQuartz may work, but some have known issues with OpenGL.

Make sure that XQuartz is configured to allow network connections.

## Known Issues

Performance is _really_ slow.  Make sure you have a snappy system.

No ROM's installed by default in image.  Looking for an option to mount host folders to the right place.
